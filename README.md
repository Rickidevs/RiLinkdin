# LinkedIn Connection Bot

A simple Python-based automation tool using Selenium to send connection requests on LinkedIn. This bot can send requests either to random suggested connections or based on a search keyword. It includes basic anti-detection measures and session management via cookies.

**Note:** This is for educational purposes only. Automating actions on LinkedIn may violate their terms of service. Use at your own risk.

## Features
- Login to LinkedIn with email/password (first time) or saved cookies for subsequent runs.
- Send connection requests to random people from the "My Network" page.
- Search for people by keyword and send targeted connection requests.
- Basic rate limiting and random delays to mimic human behavior.
- Logging of actions to a file (`linkedin_bot.log`).
- Statistics saved to `bot_stats.json`.
- Daily limit enforcement (configurable, default max 100, but recommended 20-30).

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Google Chrome browser installed (the bot uses ChromeDriver via Selenium).
- Dependencies:
  - Selenium: For browser automation.
  - Other standard libraries: `time`, `random`, `logging`, `json`, `datetime`, `os`, `pickle`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/Rickidevs/RiLinkdin.git
    cd RiLinkdin`

2. Install required Python packages:
   `pip install selenium`

3. Download the appropriate ChromeDriver version matching your Chrome browser from [chromedriver.chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Place it in your system's PATH or in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   `python main.py`

2. On first run, provide your LinkedIn email/phone and password when prompted. Cookies will be saved for future sessions.

3. Select the number of connections to send (max 50 for safety).

4. Choose mode:
- 1: Random connections from "My Network".
- 2: Search by keyword (e.g., "CEO" or "Developer").

5. The bot will handle navigation, sending requests, and logging. Check `linkedin_bot.log` for details and `bot_stats.json` for stats.

Example output:
`âœ… Total connections sent: 10
 ðŸ“… Date: 2025-09-16 12:00:00`


## Anti-Detection Measures
To avoid LinkedIn's bot detection:
- **User-Agent Spoofing:** Sets a common browser user-agent to mimic a real user.
- **Disable Automation Flags:** Removes Selenium's detectable flags like `navigator.webdriver` and disables blink features.
- **Random Delays and Actions:** Introduces random sleep times (e.g., 0.05-0.15s per keystroke, 2-5s between actions) and mouse movements via ActionChains to simulate human input.
- **No Headless Mode:** Runs in maximized window mode for more natural behavior.
- **Cookie-Based Sessions:** Reuses saved cookies to avoid frequent logins, reducing suspicious activity.

These measures help bypass basic detection, but LinkedIn may still flag excessive automation. Monitor your account closely.

## Session Management
- **Cookies Handling:** On successful login, cookies are saved to `linkedin_cookies.pkl` using `pickle`. Subsequent runs load these cookies to restore the session, skipping manual login.
- **Fallback to Manual Login:** If cookies are invalid (e.g., expired), the bot prompts for credentials again and resaves cookies.
- **State Preservation:** The bot tracks connection counts in-memory and saves stats to JSON. No persistent database is used.

## Important Notes and Warnings
- **Rate Limits:** LinkedIn has undisclosed daily/weekly limits on connections (typically 100-200/week for free accounts). The bot enforces a configurable daily limit (default 100), but it's recommended to stay under 20-30/day to avoid restrictions or bans.
- **Account Safety:** Overuse can lead to temporary restrictions, captchas, or permanent bans. Use a secondary account for testing.
- **Error Handling:** The bot logs errors to `linkedin_bot.log`. Common issues include network problems, UI changes on LinkedIn, or invalid selectors.
- **Localization Support:** Handles English and Turkish UI elements (e.g., button texts like "Connect" or "BaÄŸlan").
- **Dependencies on LinkedIn UI:** Selenium relies on XPath/CSS selectors, which may break if LinkedIn updates their site. Update selectors as needed.
- **No Personalization:** The bot sends requests without notes. Adding custom messages is not implemented.
